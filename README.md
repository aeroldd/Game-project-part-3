###dungeon.txt - A text-based dungeon crawler inspired by D&D and Rogue###

! Current features !
Most core mechanics are implemented:
- Player controlled movement
- Monster AI pathfinding using breadth first search and combat
- Dialogue system that can be easily expanded with text files
- Starting menu and character creation
- Expandable monster roster with text files
- Designable rooms and levels with text files


! PLS NOTE ITS STILL VERY INCOMPLETE !
TODO: 
- Level design
- refactoring the source code files and sort them in a proper directory structure
- shadowcasting for the player's vision, designing and balancing different monsters
- possible roguelike endless mode with procedurally generated levels
- boss monsters
- changing the room display system and game output to using curses instead of printing each update
- multiple rooms, doors and level transversal

! THIS ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS !
TODO: A proper installer or make file to build this game on different OSes and platforms
