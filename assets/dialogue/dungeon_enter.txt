Wh—Where am I?

{username}…

* {username} slowly blinks against the darkness. They lie half-buried in a cold pile of rubble, the air thick with dust and silence. Only thin shafts of light pierce through cracks in the stone above. *

* As {username} pushes the debris away and rises, an icy voice whispers through the gloom, threading chills down their spine. *

{wait}

…to face the Trials of the Blade.

{wait}

* A pale, spectral figure fades into view, suspended in the air before you. Its eyes — hollow yet piercing — lock onto yours. *

{wait}

{wait}

*The weight of destiny presses into your palm.*
